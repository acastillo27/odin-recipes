        <p><h2>Instructions</h2></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl or resealable bag, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, sliced onion, bay leaves, whole peppercorns, and sugar. Mix well to combine the marinade.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken thighs to the marinade and make sure they are coated evenly. Marinate for at least 30 minutes or refrigerate overnight for better flavor.</li>
            <li>Heat a large pan or pot over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken thighs from the marinade and set aside. Reserve the marinade for later.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, sear the chicken thighs skin-side down until browned and crispy, about 4-5 minutes. Flip the chicken thighs and brown the other side for another 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the reserved marinade into the pan with the chicken thighs. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Let it simmer for about 30-40 minutes or until the chicken is tender and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid and increase the heat to medium-high. Allow the sauce to reduce and thicken for about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce has thickened, remove the bay leaves. Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve the Filipino chicken adobo hot over steamed rice. Garnish with chopped green onions. Enjoy!</li>
